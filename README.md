My guessing game is a game of (mostly lossing) chance. 4 doors, 4 choices, each with its own fate and only one is the winner. I want the winning door to be a different number everytime. Likewise, I would like the losing statment to be randomly given after each play. The play should loop till a win is logged.

Based my ideas on the demo from the morning and the Codecadamy examples. I got the math random bit from my new JavaScript & JQuery book we got this morning. The random response string came from Brook's icebreaker code.

Coding assistance: various classmates
